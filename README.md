#Nouabook Platform
The Nouabook Platform is a website created by SimSim that aims to increase dialogue between MPs and citizens in Morocco.

>Type of project: website

##What does it do?
The website allows users to send messages to their MPs, as well as post public questions and vote for questions posted by other users.

##Credits
The Engine Room helped SimSim to redesign Nouabook for enhanced mobile responsiveness and improved user experience to maximize constructive citizen-MP dialogue. After a needs-assessment was done, UX researcher Ruth Miller was brought in. We contracted a front-end coder Andrew McNaughton, who worked with The Engine Roomâ€™s in house front-end developer, Alan Zard to convert the Sketch files with the redesigned pages, into development files. As for backend implementation, the SimSim team decided to bring Software Center (Morocco) to develop this final stage of the process. The project was paid by SimSim.
